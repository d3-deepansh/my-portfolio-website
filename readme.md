üöÄ How to Use
There are two ways to view this project:

1. Simple Static Version (Recommended for Quick Viewing)
I've created a single, self-contained index.html file that includes all the necessary code and styles. This is the easiest way to see the finished project without any setup.

Make sure you have the following files in the same folder:

index.html (the main file)

profile-pic.jpg (your profile picture)

Deepansh_Maheshwari_Resume.pdf (your resume file)

Simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your web browser.

2. Full React Project (For Development)
This is the standard way to run the project if you want to make changes or see the original development setup.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Setup Instructions:

Clone this repository or download the source code.

Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

Install all the necessary dependencies:

npm install

Start the local development server:

npm start

The website should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
